FVM CLI (Fluence VM CLI)
A command-line tool for managing Fluence VMs. FVM CLI provides a convenient interface to the Fluence API, allowing you to create, manage and monitor virtual machines in the Fluence network.

API Documentation
This CLI interacts with the Fluence API v3:

API Swagger UI: https://api.fluence.dev/swagger-ui/
Official Documentation: https://fluence.dev/docs/build/api/overview
Using from the GitHub Repository
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:boneyard93501/api-wrapper.git
cd fluence-cli

# Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
nano .env

# Install dependencies with uv
uv pip install -e .

# Run the CLI
fvm-cli --help
Configuration
The CLI uses two configuration files:

1. Environment File (.env) - For Secrets Only
Create a .env file with your API key, which you need to create on the console, and SSH key:

# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your credentials
nano .env
Your .env file should contain ONLY secrets:

# API Key from https://console.fluence.network/settings/api-keys
FLUENCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# SSH Public Key
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... user@example.com
2. Configuration File (config.yaml) - For Settings
Create/edit a config.yaml file for all other settings:

# Create default config
fvm-cli config init

# Edit as needed
nano config.yaml
The config.yaml contains all non-secret configuration:

# API Configuration
api:
  url: https://api.fluence.dev

# Default VM Configuration  
vm:
  cpu_count: 2
  memory_gb: 4
  storage_gb: 25
  region: US
  name_prefix: fvm-

# Hardware Preferences
hardware:
  cpu_manufacturer: AMD
  cpu_architecture: Zen

# Network Configuration
network:
  open_ports:
    - port: 22
      protocol: tcp
    - port: 80
      protocol: tcp
The CLI looks for config.yaml in:

Current directory
~/.config/fvm-cli/config.yaml
~/.fvm-cli/config.yaml
You can also set FVM_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to specify a custom location.

Global Options
All commands support the following global options:

--format, -f [table|json|compact]: Output format (defaults to table)
table: Formatted output with rich formatting
json: Raw JSON output for scripts and automation
compact: Minimal output for quick viewing
--debug: Show API requests and responses for troubleshooting

fvm-cli --debug --format json vm create test-vm --cpu 2 --memory 4
Using Configuration Files for VM Creation
Create a JSON configuration file matching the API schema:

{
  "constraints": {
    "basicConfiguration": "cpu-2-ram-4gb-storage-25gb",
    "datacenter": {
      "countries": ["US"]
    },
    "maxTotalPricePerEpochUsd": "5.00"
  },
  "instances": 1,
  "vmConfiguration": {
    "name": "my-fluence-vm",
    "hostname": "my-hostname",
    "osImage": "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/release/ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img",
    "sshKeys": ["ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1... user@example.com"],
    "openPorts": [
      {"port": 22, "protocol": "tcp"},
      {"port": 80, "protocol": "tcp"},
      {"port": 443, "protocol": "tcp"}
    ]
  }
}
Then create the VM with:

fvm-cli vm create --config config.json
OS Image Selection
Use the vm images command to see available OS images:

# List available images
fvm-cli vm images

# Create VM with specific image
fvm-cli vm create --image ubuntu-22-04-x64

# Create VM with custom image URL
fvm-cli vm create --image https://example.com/custom-image.qcow2

uv run tests/smoke_test.py

# Run with debug mode to see API requests
uv run tests/smoke_test.py --debug

# Specify custom resources
uv run tests/smoke_test.py --cpu 4 --memory 8 --country US

# Set a maximum price per day
uv run tests/smoke_test.py --max-price 3.50

# Skip cleanup to leave the VM running
uv run tests/smoke_test.py --no-cleanup
Available smoke test options:

--cpu CPU               Number of CPU cores (default: 2)

Overview
Fluence Console is the convenient way to rent and manage resources from the decentralized Fluence compute marketplace. It is a web-based application that allows you to control the complete lifecycle of your resources and services, including your payments and billing.

Fluence Console UI Access
info
Access to Fluence Console is currently only available to participants of the Alpha VM testing program.

Access the Fluence Console: console.fluence.network

API Access
In addition to the web interface, an API is available to programmatically:

Search for available compute resources on the marketplace
Deploy virtual machines with custom configurations
Manage active deployments
The API is ideal for automation, integration with your existing workflows, or building custom tools on top of the Fluence platform.

Learn more about using the API in our API documentation.

Introduction to the Fluence API
The Fluence API provides programmatic access to the decentralized Fluence compute marketplace. With API you can find, rent, and manage compute resources without using the web interface. This document will help you understand how to integrate Fluence's decentralized compute capabilities into your applications and workflows.

info
All API endpoints are available at:

https://api.fluence.dev/

API functionality
The API enables you to:

Search the marketplace - Find compute resources matching specific requirements for CPU, memory, storage, location, and budget
Deploy virtual machines - Create and configure VMs with your choice of operating system and network settings
Manage deployments - View active VMs, modify their configuration, and remove them when no longer needed
Manage SSH keys - View, add, and remove your SSH public keys
API requests
Authentication
All Fluence API endpoints require an API key sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
You can create and manage your keys in the Fluence Console settings guide. If you omit or supply an invalid key, youâ€™ll get a 403 code error.

Request and response format
The Fluence API accepts and returns data in JSON format. When making POST requests, set the Content-Type header to application/json.

Example request
curl -i -X POST https://api.fluence.dev/marketplace/offers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "basicConfiguration": "cpu-4-ram-8gb-storage-25gb"
  }'

Response HTTP statuses
Along with the HTTP methods that the API responds to, it will also return standard HTTP statuses, including error codes.

Success: If the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that the request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.
Error: In the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code:
Client errors: Return codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue with the request that was sent. For example, this could mean missing or invalid API key, that the object you are requesting does not exist, or that your request is malformed.
Server errors: If you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a server-side problem. This means that we are having an issue on our end and cannot fulfill your request currently.
Error response body: All 4xx/5xx responses return JSON with an error field with message providing additional information about the error.
Example error response
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    {
      "error": "Auth failed. No such API Key",
    }

Common API endpoints
The API is organized around these main resource areas:

Endpoint	Description
/marketplace/*	Endpoints for searching and discovering available compute offerings
/vms/*	Endpoints for deploying and managing virtual machines
/ssh_keys	Endpoints for managing SSH keys
API documentation resources
Swagger UI
The Fluence API also provides an Swagger UI that allows you to explore and try the API endpoints directly in your browser: https://api.fluence.dev/

API Reference
The Fluence API also provides an API Reference that provides more technical details on how to use the API: https://api.fluence.dev/docs

SSH keys and access to VMs
To access your VMs, you need to have at least one SSH key registered. Please ensure you have at least one SSH key registered in your account before creating a VM. You can do it either via the Account settings in Fluence Console or using the API endpoints described in the Manage SSH keys guide.
